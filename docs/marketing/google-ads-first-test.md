# Google Ads First Test Campaign

## 1. Goal of Test (3–7 Days)
- Validate whether Google Search traffic with price-shopping intent will click through to the new /affordable-virtual-staging landing page.
- Measure if the “2 free stagings / 5 for $9” offer generates at least a few checkout starts or purchases.
- Gather keyword-level CTR, CPC, and conversion signals to decide which intent clusters deserve deeper investment.

## 2. Landing Page Choice
- **Primary:** https://roomstagerpro.com/affordable-virtual-staging (focused offer, minimal friction, fastest path to value).
- **Secondary / Fallback:** https://roomstagerpro.com/sales (broader plan overview if we need more info-heavy visits).

## 3. Budget & Duration
- Recommend **$60–$90 per day for 5–7 days** (total $300–$600). This is enough to observe CTR and at least a handful of conversions without overcommitting.
- Pause early only if CPCs explode with zero clicks or quality score issues arise.

## 4. Campaign Settings
- **Campaign Type:** Search only.
- **Networks:** Google Search Network (exclude Search partners + Display).
- **Locations:** United States + Canada (real estate focus, similar pricing expectations).
- **Language:** English.
- **Devices:** All; adjust after data (expect strong mobile share, but keep desktop for transaction comfort).
- **Bidding:** Start with Maximize Clicks capped at ~$3.00 CPC to gather data quickly; switch to Maximize Conversions once we have ≥15 conversions, or add manual CPC if traffic quality is poor.
- **Ad Rotation:** Optimize for best performing ads.
- **Start Date:** Immediately after campaign build; set end date 7 days later with option to extend.
