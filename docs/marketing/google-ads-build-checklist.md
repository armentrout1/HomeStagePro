## 6. 24-Hour Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Review CTR and CPC for each ad group after first ~30 clicks (goal CTR ≥6%, CPC ≤$3.00).
- [ ] Pull Search Terms report; document irrelevant queries for later negative keyword build (do **not** add negatives during first 24 hours unless clearly spam/NSFW).
- [ ] Check conversion tracking logs for at least one test conversion; ensure no duplicate firing.
- [ ] Confirm ads approved (policy column). Escalate to Google support if pending >12 hours.
- [ ] Pause rules: only pause if daily spend exceeds $120 with zero clicks or if CPC >$5 for ≥50 clicks; otherwise let test run full 5–7 days.
- [ ] Log observations in shared sheet (CTR, CPC, conversions, search terms, any issues) for team review.
